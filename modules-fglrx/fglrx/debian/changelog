    thanks to Loic Minier.
    (Closes: #368802)

  * Add patch 13-config_h-is-gone to allow building on Linux 2.6.19-rc2:
    linux/config.h is no longer generated, include linux/autoconf.h instead;
    thanks to Julien BLACHE.

fglrx-driver (8.28.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Explicitly call moc-qt3, not just moc, when building the control panel.
    Fixes FTBFS when qt4-dev-tools is installed and moc-qt4 is the default.
    (Closes: #389504; really closes #383974 which was the same bug)

  * /etc/acpi/fglrx-powermode.sh tried to source /etc/default/fglrx, but the
    file we actually install is /etc/default/fglrx-driver.
    (Closes: #389744)

  * Change fglrx-driver's dependencies and description to match the switch to
    X.Org version 7.1.

  * Switch to debhelper >= 5, no changes. Actually done in 8.28.8-1, but it
    wasn't recorded in the changelog due to a slight error by my sponsor.

  * Build the man pages from source again now that Daniel's NMU of docbook-xsl
    1.70.1 has entered testing.

  [ Flavio Stanchina ]
  * Acknowledge NMU; adding changes of unreleased versions for history.
    (Closes: #355485, #366564, #375001, #378496, #383974)

  * Close remaining "new upstream version available" bugs.
    (Closes: #369039, #369043)

  * Standards-Version: 3.7.2

  * Change debian/rules and debian/control to hardcode X implementation and
    version. Now we just depend on X.Org version 7.0 and above.

  * Update man pages. Daniel Leidert, the manpages maintainer, says Debian's
    docbook stuff is hopelessly outdated, so I'm using precompiled man pages
    provided by Daniel instead of building them from the DocBook sources.
    Therefore, also remove the docbook stuff from the build dependencies.
    (Closes: #360819, #360822, #369627)

  * Patch firegl-public.c to use CONFIG_SMP rather than a custom macro defined
    by make.sh, as that script is not called when building with Linux 2.6.
    (Closes: #364762)

  * fglrx-driver provides xserver-xorg-video.
    (Closes: #365015, #385680)

  * Clean up debian/NEWS and debian/TODO.

  [ Chris Hanson ]
  * Add atieventsd and associated ACPI files.
  * Fix lintian errors:
    - debian/control: Add pre-depends on x11-common.
    - debian/fglrx-driver.shlibs: Update for changed libs.

      failing to respond.
    - Toggling between console mode and X Server graphical mode no longer
      results in a system hang.
    - Attempting to enable clone mode or extended desktop mode no longer

    complete list of the chipsets supported by the fglrx driver, as reported
    by the driver itself in the X.Org log file.

  * Split README.Debian: the part about building the kernel module goes into
    the fglrx-kernel-src package. While we're at it, expand said part by
    picking from the instructions of my old unofficial packages.
    (Closes: #343932)

 -- Norbert Tretkowski <nobse@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Jan 2006 20:29:35 +0100

fglrx-driver (8.20.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Highlights from the release notes:
    - Attempting to resume from system suspension no longer results in the
      system failing to respond.
    - Kernel module compile issues with the stock 2.6.13 and 2.6.14 kernel are
      now resolved.

  * Add support for amd64. The .orig.tar.gz file now contains the pristine
    upstream i386 and amd64 RPM files: this is less than ideal because we're
    shipping several megabytes of binary files we'll never use and two copies
    of the few files that are actually source code, but hand-picking only the
    files we actually use would be a tedious and error-prone process.
    (Closes: #341077)
    - Update copyright file accordingly.
    - Add build dependency on rpm.

  * dpkg-divert can't move files between different filesystems. Therefore,
    divert libGL to a subdirectory of /usr/X11R6/lib rather than /usr/share:
    the latter can in fact be on a different filesystem, if I understand the
    FHS correctly. On amd64, the same reasoning applies to the diversion of
    the 32-bit libGL: keep it within /emul/ia32-linux.
    (Closes: #341458)
    - This change involves some trickery with dpkg-divert. I tested several
      upgrade and downgrade scenarios and I hope I got it right, but please
      keep an eye open for any mishaps.
    - While we're at it, libGL is not architecture-independent so placing it
      anywhere within /usr/share was incorrect anyway...

  * Add dummy file "debian/include/fglrx_pp_proto.h" to be able to build the
    control panel's source code without patching it.
  * Don't ignore errors when building the control panel.
  * Add man pages from Daniel Leidert.
  * Set versioned dependency in the -dev package.
  * The driver suggests the control panel.
  * Fix handling of DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS:
    - let dh_strip handle "nostrip";
    - honor "noopt" and pass CFLAGS to sub-makes and gcc.
  * Make lintian happy (or at least happier):
    - remove unneeded extra license files;
    - add ldconfig symlinks for the shared libraries;
    - add overrides for a few problems we can't fix, at least for now.
  * Fix debian/rules to avoid installing CVS directories.

    - The latest proprietary driver introduces a resolution for drmMap

    [thanks to Alexandru for the patch]
  * Initial upload to Debian.
    - Include the complete license in debian/copyright.
    - Rename control panel package from fglrx-control-qt3 to fglrx-control.
    - Remove fglrx-sources package, it belongs in the source package.
  * Stop patching the control panel source code due to licensing issues; this
    is a workaround until ATI changes clause 1.d.vi of the license.

  * Remove call to QApplication::setStyle() from panel/main.cpp, because:
    - it was overriding the user's preferred window style;
    - it caused compilation errors in some cases.
    [thanks to Aaron for the patch]
  * Clean up the control panel's makefile; among other things, stop creating a
    bzipped copy of the panel binary that we don't use.
  * Moved binaries from usr/X11R6/bin to usr/bin.
  * Kernel 2.6.14 removes register_ioctl32_conversion() for AMD64.
  * Build-Depends on libstdc++5 because the prebuilt binaries require it.

    32-bit libraries when building the 64-bit packages.
    - We're not interested in 32-bit library dependencies anyway; users that
      want to run 32-bit applications should install ia32-libs separately.

fglrx-driver (8.14.13-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Create directory "usr/share/fglrx/diversions" in the preinst script again,
    because the package hasn't been unpacked yet at this point.
    - Unfortunately, due to what appears to be a bug in dpkg-divert, if you
      installed 8.12.10-2 from scratch rather than upgrading, it's very likely
      that the existing /usr/X11R6/lib/libGL.so.1.2 has been deleted. This has
      no consequences until the fglrx driver is installed, but if you remove
      it in the future, you'll need to reinstall xlibmesa-gl.
  * [amd64] AMD64 RPMs are in a different directory.
    [thanks to Alexandru for the hint]

  * debian/rules: revamp build target to get rid of "build-stamp".
  * debian/rules: put directory "usr/share/fglrx/diversions" in the package
    rather than creating it in the preinst script.
  * debian/rules: run dh_strip to remove unneeded debug information.
  * debian/rules: removed --remove-files from the tar call because
    a) it's pointless, as it is followed by "rm -r modules" already and
    b) doesn't work with tar 1.15 that wants options before file names.
    [thanks to Eduard Bloch and others for noticing this]
  * debian/rules: compress the module tarball with bzip2 and name it
    "fglrx.tar.bz2"; update instructions accordingly.
    [thanks to Eduard Bloch for the suggestion]
  * module/rules: warn the user if the unpacked source doesn't match the

    Build-Depend on rpl for this purpose.

  Changes by Eduard Bloch:
  * debian/README.Debian: removed the long collection of module-assistant
    calls with kernel-source specs again and again.
  * debian/control: moved kernel-package from Depends to Recommends in
    fglrx-kernel-src (it does not require it, even documented in
